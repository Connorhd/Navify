# Navify for Spotify

An attempt at a better way to manage your current playlist on Spotify

## Todo list

In no particular order.

* Show playlists in the top section. List of your playlists can't be directly accessed by apps (wtf), allow drag+drop of playlist onto app to make it aware and filter by it
* Filter by playlist, artist, album from the top section
* Search as you type filter
* Playback follows cursor
* Resizable everything (track list columns, top section, top section columns)
* Sortable columns
* App icon
